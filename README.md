# lrucaching

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cocreature/lrucaching.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cocreature/lrucaching)
[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/lrucaching.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lrucaching)

An implementation of lrucaches based on a
[blogpost](https://jaspervdj.be/posts/2015-02-24-lru-cache.html) by
Jasper Van der Jeugt.

This package has no relation to
[lrucache](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lrucache). I created it
because there were bugs in `lrucache` and the maintainer was not
responding to issues.
